# OTP Input Box — React + Vite

A small React + Vite demo app that showcases a polished, accessible, and mobile-friendly OTP (one-time password) input component. The UI mimics the common OTP input patterns found in real-world applications: evenly spaced digit boxes, keyboard-friendly auto-advance, paste support, focus styles, and validation states.

Features
- Clean, responsive OTP input UI with rounded boxes, subtle shadows, and smooth focus transitions.
- Accessibility considerations: aria labels and keyboard interactions.
- Example handlers: auto-advance, backspace to go back, and paste support for full OTP.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the app at the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).
